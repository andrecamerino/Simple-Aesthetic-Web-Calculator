# Simple-Aesthetic-Web-Calculator
The Aesthetic Calculator is a visually appealing, functional calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project combines multiple web development skills and concepts, demonstrating an understanding of front-end technologies and interactive design.

Concepts and Skills:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Structuring the calculator interface.
Defining various elements like buttons, input fields, and container divs.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Styling the calculator with custom colors, gradients, and shadows.
Applying modern design techniques, such as CSS variables (:root), responsive design (flexbox), and transitions.
Enhancing user interaction with hover and active states.

JavaScript:
Adding interactivity to the calculator buttons using onclick events.
Implementing functions (appendToDisplay, calculate, clearDisplay) to handle input, perform calculations, and clear the display.
Ensuring a smooth user experience through dynamic content updates.

This project is inspired by Bro Code's Calculator Tutorial video on YouTube, which provides a comprehensive guide to creating a calculator using modern web development practices. You can watch the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5kj-YsmWjM.
